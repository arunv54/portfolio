						<h3>Guide: Eyantra - IIT Bombay</h3>
						<p>[Sept'22 - Feb'23]</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						The project aimed at revolutionizing surveillance and emergency response through the development
						of an advanced drone system. The primary objective was to create a versatile drone that could
						autonomously monitor and report various incidents, such as accidents and fires, as well as
						detect any unusual activities or anomalies in a given area. To achieve this, we harnessed the
						power of image processing technology and seamlessly integrated it with a Geographic Information
						System (GIS) for efficient data management and analysis.
					</p>
					<p>
						The journey began with the software development phase, where we meticulously designed and
						implemented the core functionalities of our surveillance drone. We chose to utilize ROS Noetic,
						a highly versatile and widely adopted robotics framework, as the foundation of our software
						architecture. Additionally, we employed Gazebo, a powerful robotics simulation environment, to
						rigorously test and refine our algorithms before transitioning to the hardware phase.
					</p>
					<p>
						During the simulation phase, we crafted a virtual environment in Gazebo to emulate real-world
						scenarios. This allowed us to evaluate the drone's performance in a controlled environment,
						fine-tune its navigation algorithms, and optimize its image processing capabilities. It also
						facilitated the development of a robust communication system for data transmission between the
						drone and the GIS platform.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to ensure precise control of the drone's position and orientation in 3D space, we
						implemented a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller during the simulation phase.
						This PID controller played a pivotal role in stabilizing and maneuvering the drone, enhancing
						its overall performance and responsiveness. To achieve this, we integrated a sophisticated
						whycon marker detection system. A high-resolution camera mounted on the ceiling captured
						real-time images of the drone's flight area. The whycon marker, a distinctive visual marker
						affixed to the drone's body, served as a reference point. By analyzing the marker's position and
						orientation in the camera's field of view, our PID controller made rapid and precise adjustments
						to the drone's position, roll, pitch, and yaw. This not only allowed for accurate tracking of
						the drone's movements but also ensured its ability to maintain stable flight even in challenging
						conditions, making it a highly reliable tool for automated surveillance and incident response in
						real-world environments.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once we were satisfied with the results in the virtual realm, we proceeded to the hardware
						implementation phase. Here, we assembled a compact nano drone equipped with the ESC, camera,
						Bannan Pi, Li-Po battery, brushless motors, and propellers to replicate the functionality
						developed in the simulation. This physical drone was designed to execute the same surveillance
						tasks as its virtual counterpart but in real-world environments, ensuring the robustness and
						reliability of our system.
					</p>
					<p>
						The implementation of PID control in hardware differed from the simulation phase due to the
						real-world constraints and dynamics of the nano drone. In the hardware implementation, we had to
						account for the physical limitations of the drone's sensors, actuators, and the environment it
						operated in. We fine-tuned the PID parameters through extensive testing and experimentation in
						real-world conditions. The key challenge was dealing with external factors such as wind,
						humidity, and variations in lighting conditions that could affect the drone's performance. This
						required a robust and adaptive PID control system that could dynamically adjust its parameters
						to maintain stable flight.
					</p>
					<p>
						In practice, our surveillance drone autonomously patrols designated areas, capturing images and
						video footage through its onboard cameras. These images are processed in real-time using
						computer vision techniques to identify accidents, fires, or any unusual activities. When an
						incident is detected, the drone initiates an immediate response by transmitting the relevant
						data to the GIS platform for analysis and visualization.
					</p>
					<p>
						The integration with the GIS platform is a pivotal component of our system. It enables the
						collected data to be efficiently managed, geospatially analyzed, and shared with relevant
						control station for prompt action. GIS not only serves as a central hub for data storage but
						also provides a comprehensive visual representation of incidents and anomalies, aiding
						decision-makers in coordinating effective responses.
					</p>
					<p>
						In conclusion, our project represents a fusion of robotics, image processing, and GIS
						technologies. By developing a drone capable of autonomously surveilling and reporting incidents,
						we have taken a step towards enhancing emergency response, public safety, and overall
						situational awareness in various contexts, from disaster management to urban surveillance. Our
						approach, coupled with the thorough simulation and hardware validation, ensures the reliability
						and efficiency of our automated surveillance system in real-world applications.
